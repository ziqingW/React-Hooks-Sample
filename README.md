## Reminders (by React-Hooks)  
A sample of single-page-app as Reminder built with pure React-Hooks. No React class component was created in this app. All state values and events were managed and controlled by hooks function. Generally, I used useState to create state variables and setters for them. It's easy and clear.  

You can add new or delete old reminds for each individual booklet. The edit function will be included in the later version.

### Pains:
- Since I'm still learning how to use React-Hooks, I'm a little confused about the usage of Redux with Hooks  
- Need to pay attention on JavaScript hoist
